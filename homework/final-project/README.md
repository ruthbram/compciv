For this assignment, I worked with the California Department of Education website

I saw this article: http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr14/yr14rel42.asp,
which says that the High School Graduation Rate Tops 80 percent. 
I know, from visiting schools throughout CA, that that data seemed a bit high.
I would hope that graduation rates are going up, but it's important to recognize 
that there are still dropouts. I wanted to get a sense of how the dropout rate
has changed over time. So I took graduation and droupout data from four links 
for four academic years, and attached addresses for each year. I chose 50 
schools from each year (to condense info for the purposes of this assignment)
and output a file that could be input into Google Fusion Tables. Below are the
drections for achieving that Excel file with the data. I've also included the 
final results as links below, as well as my findings. Thanks!

Collecting the list of all schools in Calfiornia with dropout rates 
would have been an incredibly large file. 
So I chose the top 50 lines for each academic year 
(09-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13) so that I had a total of 200 schools.

Here are my results, in a Fusion Table:

to see the custom map of the data.

10-11 data

11-12 data

12-13 data

Please note, that after I transferred the data to the fusion 
tables, I had to clean up a few things so that Google could read 
the data. I also had to erase a few outliers from each academic year.
As a result, instead of 200 schools, I am down to about 160 schools.

Results were somewhat interesting. if you open all four links, and put
them in order from the earliest to latest academic year, you can see that 
the "red" color (marked with the heatmap option) is more apparent.
