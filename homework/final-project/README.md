Collecting the list of all schools in Calfiornia with dropout rates 
would have been an incredibly large file. 
So I chose the top 50 lines for each academic year 
(09-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13) so that I had a total of 200 schools.

Here are my results, in a Fusion Table:

09-10 data

10-11 data
https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1lGH8IOPiBKfYIaPdhbzAGbshmL7LeoPL0Q90PkPE

11-12 data
https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1wKKyXq-QqHxb0USWxhBvVNohnAh1Wz2Cxc-lqvwe

12-13 data
https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1z-QRR15IfxrIyqfMCwiX1hBxmioycFJbOGot36Ef

Please note, that after I transferred the data to the fusion 
tables, I had to clean up a few things so that Google could read 
the data. I also had to erase a few outliers from each academic year.
As a result, instead of 200 schools, I am down to about 160 schools.

Results were somewhat interesting. if you open all four links, and put
them in order from the earliest to latest academic year, you can see that 
the "red" color (marked with the heatmap option) is more apparent.
