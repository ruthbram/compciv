My project:
In 2009 I became passionate about helping at-risk students graduate high school. 
There is a large percentage of California's public school population dropping out, 
and it's an issue that's difficult to solve. Nonetheless, I wanted to find out why 
there were so many students dropping out. From 2009 to 2012 I visited schools and 
spoke to students about staying in school. Since I was a performing musician, I 
knew how music and changed my life and kept me going strong in school; so I 
developed several music education programs that could help students engage in 
their schoolwork and enjoy learning. 

Mission:
I'd like to pay another visit to my past research and look deeper into the 
statistics from the past few years by downloading high school graduation and 
dropout rates, as well as data that shows the amount of music funding. I want 
to create a fusion table to see the change over time (4 year period) in regards 
to number of dropouts and amount of music funding. 

Resources:
List of high school cohorts

List of high school addresses
http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/si/ds/pubschls.asp

List of Art and Music Block Grants
http://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/ca/artsandmusic.asp 
Process:

Part 1:
Download documents with the list of schools, 
Download addresses of high schools, 
Download data of Art and Music grants  

Separate documents by academic year. There should be four.
The reason for doing this is, at the end, we want to see the change over 
time in regards to number of dropouts and amount music funding. 

Part 2:
Combine address of high schools with the list of schools, 
Create Excel doc with:  
1. the top 20 schools that have the highest dropout rate, 
2. the addresses, 
3. the total amount of music funding

Part 3:
Create a Google fusion table that shows this data with dots on the graph. 
Users should be able to hover over and see the name of the school, the 
dropout rate, and the amount of music funding.
