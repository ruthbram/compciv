Reasoning for choosing this project:
In 2009 I became passionate about helping at-risk students graduate high school. 
There is a large percentage of California's public school population dropping out, 
and it's an issue that's difficult to solve. Nonetheless, I wanted to find out why 
there were so many students dropping out. From 2009 to 2012 I visited schools and 
spoke to students about staying in school. Since I was a performing musician, I 
knew how music and changed my life and kept me going strong in school; so I developed 
several music education programs that could help students engage in their schoolwork 
and enjoy learning. 

Mission:
I'd like to pay another visit to my past research and look deeper into the statistics 
from the past few years by downloading state, county, district, and school graduation 
and dropout rates. I did some preliminary research and found two links (posted above), 
which show this info. I'm hoping to find something interesting and will look into
this more in order to finish my proposal this week.
